# Operators in python:
# 1. Arithmetic Operators 
# 2. Comparison Operators
# 3. logical Operators
# 4. Identity Operators
# 5. Membership Operators
# 6. Bitwise Operators
# 7. Assignment Operators

  # 1. Arithmetic Operators 
# print("5 + 6  is ", 5+6)
# print("5 - 6  is ", 5-6)
# print("5 * 6  is ", 5*6)
# print("5 / 6  is ", 5/6)
# print("5 // 6  is ", 5//6) # Floor division is an operation in Python that divides two numbers and rounds the result down to the nearest integer.
# print("5 ** 6  is ", 5**6) # same as power()
# print("5 % 6  is ", 5%6)


# 2. Assignment Operators
# print("Assignment Operators")
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x %=7 # x = x%7
# print(x)



# 3. Comparison Operators
# i=8
# print(i==5) # prints False 

# 4. logical Operators
# a=True
# b= False
# print(a and a) # prints True
# print(a or b) # prints  True


# 5. Identity Operators
# a=True
# b= False
# print(a is b) # prints false
# print(a is not  b) # prints true


# 6. Membership Operators
# list =[2,6,7,99,32,44]
# print(32 in list) # prints True
# print(32  not in list) # prints false

# 7. Bitwise Operators[ it works on bit ]
# 0-00
# 1-01
# 2-10
# 3-11

# print (0&1)
# print (0|1)
