print("Hello World I'm at the Top") # yaha par comma laga diya hai to space aa jayegi!! agar 2 bar print ho to 1st time print k baad ek new line character add hoga !!

print("Thank you !!" , end=" Everyone \n" )
print("Thank you !!" , end=" Everyone \n" )

#Escape characters
print ("C:\palak")
print ("C:\nalak") #here \n is new line character so use escape character before it like below!!
print ("C:\\nalak") # output -> nalak
